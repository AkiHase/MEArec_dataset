# MEArec_dataset
These datasets are generated by [MEArec](https://github.com/alejoe91/MEArec) and used to evaluate the performance of Spike Sorting algorithms in our paper. 
A total of **nine** different specifications of the dataset were prepared, each of which contains **five** copies of data generated using different random seeds. The different random seeds affect the background noise of the signal and the template shape of the spike signal.
